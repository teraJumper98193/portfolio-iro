title: Judo vs Karate.
---

The task of late or checkpoint in BLOC is to complete coding challenges in Codewars. This is basically a coding dojo and each challenge is called a Kata. The purpose is to challenge yourself and input correct code given the specific instructions and an outcome awaiting failure or passing. Not an easy task I may reveal. Material does not always follow the previous checkpoints and new ideas are introduced to trip up and defeat the opponent. You can choose different languages and/or difficulty rating. I've been trying many times at one particular challenge without success so far but I'm getting closer; I can feel it and see the partial passing. Time to continue the fight! Stay tuned. Shipping code. Anything is possible.
