What a place! What an office! To be only so lucky to work in such an environment. Lunch area felt like a colllege campus. Free food, free beer, free wine! Beer pong tables and bean bag set ups :) Where do I sign up please? Of course the work gets done as well. All is open space. Views are spectacular. Couches here and there. All look young and all are smiling. What's their secret? Let me in please. Oh that would be so nice. Hopefully I will be as lucky as they are. Quite a different environment from what I am used to. Think cubicle lands. Ugh. Must do better. Must code better. Stay tuned!
