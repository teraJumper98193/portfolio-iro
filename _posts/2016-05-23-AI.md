AI or Artificial Intelligence. So much in the news lately. Go, an ancient Chinese game, was finally the latest instrument to be chalenged vs a human. Human finally lost. A shock to many but inevitable. What's next? Will Watson, IBM AI, replace all doctors? I have read also about a lawfirm using AI to replace the junior associates. Computers are learning to play games like Mario and Sonic. They are learning from mistakes. Do they know right from wrong? Ex Machina was a great movie depicting human weakness at its best. Will we be able to outsmart the machines? Skynet? So many questions. I believe Google has pulled out of Robotics as the progress may have scared them. Think Boston Dynamics Robotics company. Do we even need to work anymore? Will that cause chaos? Or will that be the perfect world few imagined? Time will tell. Stay tuned. And Bloccit is almost done. Alexa project is next :) Time to code.
