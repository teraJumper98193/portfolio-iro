So the next skill I did was a Fact based skill on F1. I've been a fan for a long time and have watched every season since 1996. I have been to Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal as well as US GP in Indianapolis and Austin. I even tried to get some racing pedigree via Skip Barber and their 3 day racing school. Very fun but very expensive. Finding info for this skill was not too hard as this form of motorsport is the most popular in the world! Plenty of facts and info available on google search. Most of the words are easy to say and the names are not as difficult as the Spanish soccer players. No problem for Alexa. Amazing facts for an amazing Echo. Launch the skill with "Alexa, open Formula 1 facts". Link below:

Time to code. Stay tuned.
