So I just got a bitter lesson in GiHub and needed to re-do my project. Actually it was a blessing in disguise as the second time around was way faster and also easier to connect the dots along the way. Hopefully this is the last time I need to go from square one again but I doubt it. Seems as though it is the norm and not the uncommon way to test and retest given code in RSpec and/or other. I continue on building the necessary pieces of the webpage including routers, views, controllers and models. It's making more and more sense but who am I fooling. I need a lot more practice to fully grasp what is going on here. I do enjoy viewing the final product as we make the changes in the code. How did we get here? How was it done before? Where are we going? Time to code. Stay tuned. '
