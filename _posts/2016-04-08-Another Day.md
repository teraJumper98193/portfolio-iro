Another week; Another dollar.

It's amazing how fast time flies. Seemed so slow when little and now it's light speed. Or so it seems. I digress. Back to main topics. Or one topic. I finally got around to doing a Linked In page again mainly for the Bloc crowd who have yet to find me. It's connected via a link on top on my brand new web page! Me so proud. Never had a web page before. Well that's a lie, once I had the idea of setting up a photo web page. Bought a domain but never got around to develop it. Bummer. This one looks neat. Some even said professional. I'm glad. As Mark mentioned, it may be one of the ropes leading to a new job. Let's hope and be ready. Time to ship code. Next up is a Basic Rails App. Sounds like fun. I like to get instant gratification when I'm doing something difficult. It motivates and energizes me. Off I go. Stay tuned.
