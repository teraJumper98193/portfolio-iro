---layout: posttitle: Biggest Challenge so far Learning to Code.---It definitely has to be time. At times I get frustrated and waste time venting on other activities. Or I spend too much time on one problem trying to figure out exactly what’s intended to be done. Or the instructions or the installation of the software is not clear to me. I’m a bit hard on my self and try to be get it all at once I guess. It’s not easy and it is all new material to me. Certain sections are more fun than others. You kind of get that positive reinforcement feeling right away. Others seem to drag on forever. Being that it’s online you must have a of discipline to shut off all other stimuli around you which is easier said than done. Once frustrated and you just happen to check other web pages it wastes valuable time spent not working. It’s amazing how fast time flies. Some of the concepts are difficult to grasp and you have to be in the zone and clear minded to really understand what is going on. For me personally that is usually evening and night time. Total distraction free zone. But at times it conflicts with regular life and this is something I have yet to master. Keyboard time is what I need most now to be successful and time is the enemy at times.
