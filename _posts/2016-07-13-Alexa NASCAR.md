Here we go again! 3rd time is the charm as they say. My new skill covers facts about the most popular motorsport in the USA and beyond. I'm getting used to building these :) Actually it's not that hard once you built a few. Amazon has made the process very user friendly. First you'll need an account with Amazon Web Services / AWS (Cloud). Out of all the options pick Lambda and create a new function. You can paste in or upload your code and then check a few options and you're almost done. Run a few tests to see if your Node.js runs smoothly. Next head over to the Developer Portal and set up an account. Click on Alexa/Skills Kit and add a new skill. This is the area where you'll get to name and import your skill. Very straight forward. Testing also takes place and usually is the longest part of the whole process. Add a few pics and an Invocation Name. Description is where you get to hook new users onto your skill, make it fun and make it entertaining. Submit it for publishing and wait until your skill is approved/Live. Try everything and just have fun! :)

Amazing facts for an amazing Echo. Launch the skill with "Alexa, open stock car racing". Link below:
