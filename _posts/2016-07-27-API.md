API project is stalled. I'm working with the mentor to fix the bugs now. So frustrating. May need to start from beginning. All we try does not work :( May be an issue with my HD but I tried Cloud9 and same thing happened. All it has to do is return True when I request Kele. Not a happy month. But tomorrow I'm in NYC for a AWS event :) 

Time to code. Stay tuned.
