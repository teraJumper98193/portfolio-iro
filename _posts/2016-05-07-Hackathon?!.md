title: Hackathon?!
---

So I had a meeting with my BLOC advisor and we started talking about meet-ups. I checked my Facebook and amazingly there was a TechCrunch Hackathon starting that day! I got all excited and purchased a spectator ticket. Got ready and off I went. Drove all the way to Brooklyn and waited in line. Then the guy at the door had a problem scanning my ticket. Manager or Supervisor came over and informed me that it was only a time for the Hackers to sign in and register. Spectators can come tomorrow at the end! Ugh! I can't even watch :( Maybe next time! Time to code. Stay tuned.
