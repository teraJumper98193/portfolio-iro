title: Robot vs Valley.
---

I've started watching a few tech shows of late and I'm more sucked into the world of Mr.Robot vs Silicon Valley. One is based in NYC and focuses on cyber security while the other is based in Palo Alto/San Fran and focuses on start ups. I must admit I like the NYC/Cybersecurity world or the show portaing it more intersting. Maybe it's just a better made show. The scenery looks familiar, the world seems more legit and the plot more realistic so far. More mystery and more dark characters always sells I guess. Besdies that I'm in the world of CRUD. All working fine until I hit a bug yet to be killed off. I'm following the directions but I'm not getting the same results. Maybe a space or a period or somehing else is the matter. This usually takes most time to diagnose. Time to code. And I should have posted this yesterday; I know. Stay tuned.
