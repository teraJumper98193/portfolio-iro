I'm bulding a music page! :) It's pretty cool, trust me. The front main page is done and now I'm adding a link to the second page with the music collection of the user. It all looks very professional and user friendly. I like working with HTML and CSS. Digital painting especially with the CSS properties, endless possibilities. But I'm told this is usually done by the designer, not the software engineer. Interesting, I guess I must get good at HTML then. I wonder wat's next! :)

Time to code. Stay tuned.
