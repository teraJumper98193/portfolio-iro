title: UBER Time

And so I have offically joined the UBER crowd. Partly for the money and partly for the tech. Economics are also very interesting. The tech is all seamlesss and cash less unless you receive a tip; a rare event. I'm told there are only two drivers in my area and thus we basically have a monopoly. The app tracks your location constantly. All have their credit cards or bank accounts linked. The maps show surge pricing based upon supply and demand for the cars in that area. You can spend all day chasing the surge price but you may be dissapointed as the map seems to be slowly updated and thus wastes time and gas. There's no guessing about pricing as the client receives an estimate of the fare beforehand. The power thus seems to have transferred from the driver to the passenger. The driver also does not know the destination of the ride until client enters the car. This is done to prevent discrimination I'm told. Overall it's a good experience. Easy app to use and install. Minimal training and minimum requirements. Work when you want or need to. One day I suspect the driver will be replaced entirely by software like in many Sci Fi movies of the past. The future is now.
