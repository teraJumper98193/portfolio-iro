So the Ruby Foundations is done! :) Now it's project time. The first one is Amazon Alexa. I have to develop a trivia game for the Echo. I picked a popular topic for this June and have written 100 questions/answers. Now it's off to AWS Developer environment and testing. Hopefully all goes well and I can publish my first project to the public! :) I'll reveal the projects name next time and post a link. Get your Amazon Echo now! Best thing since sliced bead. Time to code. Stay tuned!
