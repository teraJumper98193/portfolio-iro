title: Hello Front End Course
---

And so after much frustration the API project has been finally finished. Now it's time for a new chapter :) The next phase in this adventure is Front End; Java Script, HTML and CSS. This is basically all you see each time you open up a web page. Sort of like digital painting :) But before I start the official program I need to finish the Pre Work required via Codecademy. New level, new beginning. 

Time to code. Stay tuned!
